        <h1 id="title">Fernando Alonso</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Fernando Alonso Díaz</b> is a Spanish racing driver currently
          racing for Alpine in Formula One. He won the series' World Drivers'
          Championship in 2005 and 2006 with Renault, having also driven for
          McLaren, Ferrari and Minardi. With Toyota, Alonso won the 24 Hours of
          Le Mans twice, in 2018 and 2019, and the FIA World Endurance
          Championship in 2018–19. In 2019, he won the 24 Hours of Daytona with
          Wayne Taylor Racing. Born in Oviedo, Asturias to a working-class
          family, he began go-karting at the age of three and achieved success
          in local, national and world championships. Alonso progressed to car
          racing at age 17, winning the Euro Open by Nissan in 1999 and was
          fourth in the International Formula 3000 Championship of 2000. He
          debuted in Formula One with Minardi in 2001 before joining Renault as
          a test driver for 2002. Promoted to a race seat in 2003, Alonso won
          two drivers' championships in 2005 and 2006, becoming (at the time)
          the youngest pole-sitter, youngest race winner, youngest world
          champion, and youngest two-time champion in the sport's history. After
          finishing third with McLaren in 2007, he returned to Renault for 2008
          and 2009 and won two races in the former year for fifth overall.
          Alonso drove for Ferrari from 2010 to 2014, finishing runner-up to
          Sebastian Vettel in three tightly-contested title duels in 2010, 2012,
          and 2013. A second stint with McLaren from 2015 to 2018 resulted in no
          further success. At the time of his first retirement, Alonso had won
          32 Formula One races, 22 pole positions, and 1,899 points from 311
          starts. He is currently the only Spanish Formula One driver to have
          won either a Grand Prix or the World Championship. He won the 2001
          Race of Champions Nations Cup with the rally driver Jesús Puras and
          the motorcyclist Rubén Xaus for Team Spain and thrice entered the
          Indianapolis 500 in 2017, 2019 and 2020. Alonso has been awarded the
          Prince of Asturias Award for Sports, the Premios Nacionales del
          Deporte Sportsman of the Year Award and the Gold Medal of the Royal
          Order of Sports Merit and has twice been inducted into the FIA Hall of
          Fame. He runs an eSports and junior racing team and is a UNICEF
          Goodwill Ambassador.

          <p>
            Aged 17, Alonso made his car racing debut in the 1999
            <b>Euro Open by Nissan</b> with Campos Motorsport, winning the title
            from Manuel Gião at the final race of the season with six wins and
            nine pole positions.For 2000, he progressed to the higher-tier
            International Formula 3000 Championship with the Minardi-backed Team
            Astromega, after a sponsorship agreement with driver Robert Lechner
            fell through.Alonso finished second at the Hungaroring and won the
            season-ending round at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps for fourth
            overall with 17 points.

          </h4>
          <p>
            Cesare Fiorio, the sports director, gave Alonso a test in a Formula
            One car at the Circuito de Jerez in December 1999 as part of the
            Euro Open by Nissan's organising company RPM agreement to give its
            series champion an opportunity to test at a higher level. He was
            <b>Minardi's</b> test and reserve driver in 2000 before
            <b>joining its race team in 2001</b

              style="width: 250px; float: left; margin-right: 8px"
            />. In a non-competitive car, Alonso's best result of the season was
            a tenth-place finish in the German Grand Prix and scored no points
            for 23rd overall.
          </p>

          <p id="renault">
            He signed as Renault's test driver for <b>2002</b> per the orders of
            manager Flavio Briatore to familiarise himself with the team and
            improve himself for the future. Alonso worked with the engineering
            department to improve Giancarlo Fisichella's and Jenson Button's
            performance, and tested in Spain and the United Kingdom. He drove a
            Jaguar in an evaluation session against test drivers André Lotterer
            and James Courtney at the Silverstone Circuit in May 2002.
            <b>Alonso was promoted to the Renault race team for 2003</b>.

            He went on to break the records of youngest driver to win a pole
            position at the season's second race, the Malaysian Grand Prix, and
            broke Bruce McLaren's record as the
            <b>youngest Formula One race winner at the Hungarian Grand Prix</b>
            later in the year. He achieved four podium finishes in 2003 and was
            sixth in the World Drivers' Championship with 55 points.
          </p>

          <p>
            He remained with Renault for <b>2004</b>. Alonso had an improved
            season: he finished the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in
            third position and took three more podium finishes that year. He
            took pole position for the French Grand Prix and achieved no race
            victories en route to fourth in the World Drivers' Championship with
            59 points.Alonso stayed at Renault for <b>2005</b>. He duelled with
            McLaren driver Kimi Räikkönen for the World Championship in 2005 due
            to regulation changes mandating teams not to change tyres during a
            race and engines had to last for two races before they could be
            changed. Alonso's car was more reliable than Räikkönen's albeit
            lacking in speed. Alonso eclipsed Emerson Fittipaldi as the
            <b>youngest World Drivers' Champion</b> with seven victories, six
            pole positions and fourteen podium finishes for 133 points.

            He signed a contract extension with Renault for <b>2006</b> in April
            2005. Bookmakers installed Alonso as the favourite to retain the
            Drivers' Championship. His primary competition was Ferrari driver
            <b>Michael Schumacher</b>. Alonso won six of the first nine races
            and finished no lower than second to lead the championship with 84
            out of a possible 90 points. An Fédération Internationale de
            l'Automobile (FIA; Formula One's governing body)-imposed ban on
            Renault's tuned mass damper device to slow Alonso and an increase of
            development into Schumacher's Ferrari for competitiveness saw the
            two tied on points entering the season's penultimate round, the
            Japanese Grand Prix. Alonso won the race as Schumacher retired due
            to an engine failure whilst leading. He needed to score one point at
            the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix for a second title.

            He and McLaren team owner Ron Dennis met secretly in Japan after
            Dennis talked to Alonso about driving for the team in the future and
            Alonso expressed interest in the idea. Both men agreed to a
            three-year contract for
            <b>Alonso to drive for McLaren starting from 2007</b>. Alonso's
            contract with Renault expired on 31 December 2006, and he was not
            granted an early release for sponsorship reasons. Renault allowed
            Alonso to make his first appearance for McLaren in a test session at
            the Circuito de Jerez in November 2006.
            <img

              style="width: 250px; float: right; margin-left: 8px"
            />
            His main competitors in 2007 were his teammate Lewis Hamilton and
            Räikkönen at Ferrari. Alonso achieved four Grand Prix victories in
            Malaysia, Monaco, Europe and Italy and led the championship until
            Hamilton overtook him. Prior to the season's final round, the
            Brazilian Grand Prix, he had 103 championship points to Räikkönen's
            100 and Hamilton's 107, and needed to win the race and for his
            teammate to finish third or lower for his third title. Alonso
            finished the event third for third overall with 109 points. He had
            the same number of points as Hamilton; the tie was broken on
            count-back as Hamilton finished second more often than Alonso.
          </p>
          <p id="renault2">
            Throughout the season, Alonso and Hamilton were involved in a number
            of incidents, such as the espionage scandal and the flare-up during
            qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix when Hamilton disobeyed a
            team instruction, thus disadvantaging Alonso, and Alonso responded
            by delaying Hamilton in the pit lane. The tensions culminated in
            Alonso and McLaren terminating their contract by mutual consent in
            November. Alonso was forbidden from joining a team whom McLaren
            considered their primary challengers for 2008. After rejecting
            offers from several teams, he signed a
            <b>two-year contract to rejoin Renault from 2008</b> because of the
            manufacturer's long-term commitment to Formula One and on-track
            record.

              style="width: 250px; float: left; margin-right: 8px"
            />Alonso's car lacked power early on due to an imposed moratorium in
            development and he scored nine points in the first seven races. He
            was thereafter able to improve his performance later due to
            aerodynamic developments to the car's and won in Singapore and
            Japan; the former race saw Renault order his teammate Nelson Piquet
            Jr. to crash deliberately and trigger the deployment of the safety
            car in what became known as "crashgate". Alonso scored more points
            than any other driver in the final five races with 43. He scored 61
            points for fifth in the Drivers' Championship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alonso was due to become a free agent for <b>2009</b> if Renault
            were lower than third in the Constructors' Championship.[ After
            offers from Red Bull Racing and Honda, he resigned to Renault on a
            two-year contract. His car proved to be noncompetitive because it
            lacked a dual diffuser system and outright speed. Alonso eschewed an
            aerodynamic front wing mandated in an attempt to make overtaking
            more possible since he did not believe it would help him. He scored
            points in eight races and achieved one podium finish: a third-place
            at the Singapore Grand Prix. Alonso won pole position for the
            Hungarian Grand Prix and led the first 12 laps before he retired
            following an incorrectly fitted right-front wheel. Alonso was ninth
            in the Drivers' Championship with 26 points, his lowest placing
            since he came sixth in 2003;
            <b

            He agreed with Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo to
            drive for Ferrari in 2009, but team principal Jean Todt extended the
            contracts of both Felipe Massa and Räikkönen to 2010.

              style="width: 250px; float: right"
            />
            Alonso obtained a mid-2009 agreement to drive for Ferrari from 2011
            on but it was moved to 2010 after Renault were investigated for race
            fixing in Singapore and Räikkönen was released from the team.
            McLaren's Hamilton and Button and Red Bull's of Sebastian Vettel and
            Mark Webber were Alonso's main championship competition. He won five
            races that season and entered the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix
            leading by eight points after being 47 behind mid-season following
            errors. Alonso finished runner-up to Vettel after he was unable to
            pass Renault's Vitaly Petrov following a strategy error by Ferrari.
          </p>
          <p>
            His <b>2011</b> season was mixed: his car was built conservatively
            and lacked aerodynamic grip and tyre handling in qualifying. He
            extracted additional pace from his car to claim ten podium finishes
            and win the British Grand Prix after a strategy error from Red Bull.
            His best qualification of the year was a second at the Canadian
            Grand Prix and he out-qualified his teammate Massa fifteen times
            over the course of the season. Alonso was fourth overall with 257
            points; he was in contention to finish second to eventual champion
            Vettel following a series of strong finishes until Webber won the
            season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ahead of <b>2012</b>, Alonso extended his contract with Ferrari
            until 2016. His main competition for the title in 2012 was Vettel.
            Wins in Malaysia, Valencia and Germany and consistent points-scoring
            finishes allowed him to build a 40-point lead in the Drivers'
            Championship.

            />
            Thereafter start-line collisions, a mechanical failure and an
            improved performance for Vettel eliminated Alonso's points lead.
            Alonso entered the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix 13 points
            behind Vettel and needed to finish third and for Vettel not to score
            points for a third championship. He was second and Vettel finished
            fourth to be runner-up for the second time in his career on 278
            points.
          </p>
          <p>
            To begin <b>2013</b>, Alonso drove an aggressively designed car
            allowing him to win in China and Spain and consistently scored
            points.

            He was slower than Vettel after a change of tyre compound at the
            German Grand Prix and front and rear bodywork components intended to
            improve his car's performance were ineffective. With 242 points,
            Alonso was second for the third time in his career. His relationship
            with Ferrari cooled due to his perception the team could not
            construct a title-winning car.Alonso's <b>2014</b> season saw him
            achieve no race wins because his <b>car was less powerful</b> than
            the championship-winning Mercedes but took third in the Chinese
            Grand Prix and second in the Hungarian Grand Prix. Alonso fell to
            sixth in the Drivers' Championship with 161 points. He qualified
            faster than his teammate Räikkönen 16 times by an average of more
            than ½ second per lap in 2014.

          <h4 id="mclaren2">Return to McLaren (2015-2018)</h4>
          <p>
            Alonso had severe disagreements with team principal Marco Mattiacci
            in 2014 and left Ferrari after contract negotiations to remain at
            the team fell through.
            <b
              >He rejoined McLaren on a three-year contract from 2015 to 2017</b
            >
            with no opt-out clauses. An accident during a pre-season test
            session at Spain's Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in February 2015
            saw Alonso sustain a concussion and he was replaced by reserve
            driver Kevin Magnussen for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.
            He endured a difficult season: his car's Honda engine was
            under-powered and overall speed leaving him vulnerable to being
            passed. Alonso scored points twice in <b>2015</b>: a tenth in the
            British Grand Prix and a fifth in the Hungarian Grand Prix for 17th
            in the Drivers' Championship with 11 points. He was dissatisfied
            with a slow pace, which became evident after multiple radio
            complaints that year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the unreliable and noncompetitive car, Alonso remained for
            McLaren for <b>2016</b>. Injuries from a heavy crash with Esteban
            Gutiérrez at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix caused him to

            Bahrain Grand Prix on medical grounds and was replaced by reserve
            driver Stoffel Vandoorne. Alonso qualified better than teammate
            Button fifteen times and scored points nine times, which included
            two fifth-place finishes in the Monaco Grand Prix and the United
            States Grand Prix. He was tenth in the Drivers' Championship with 54
            points. Alonso told his colleagues he would stay at McLaren in
            <b>2017</b>. Poor reliability affected his season, particularly
            during the early rounds, and his best finish was a seventh in the
            Hungarian Grand Prix. After three consecutive top-ten finishes,
            Alonso finished 15th in the Drivers' Championship with 17 points.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following contract negotiations with the McLaren CEO Zak Brown,
            Alonso signed a multi-year extension with McLaren on 19 October
            2017. He finished fifth at the season-opening <b>2018</b> Australian
            Grand Prix and took nine top-ten finishes.
            <b
              >Alonso out-qualified his teammate Stoffel Vandoorne at every race
              and drove quickly and aggressively</b
            >. He became increasingly annoyed with certain drivers and his
            commitment to Formula One waned after McLaren stopped developing his
            car to focus on 2019. Alonso was 11th in the Drivers' Championship
            with 50 points, and
            <b>left the sport as a driver at the end of the 2018 season</b>,
            citing a perceived lack of on-track racing, the predictability of
            results and felt discussions away from racing about the broadcast of
            radio transmissions and polemics harmed the series.

            Alonso was signed to drive for Alpine F1 Team for the 2021 and 2022
            seasons, alongside Esteban Ocon, after Renault rebranded the
            teamname to Alpine from 2021 onwards. In preparation for his Formula
            One return, Alonso performed four testing days driving the Renault
            R.S.18 and topped the timing charts in the post 2020 season young
            driver's test driving the Renault R.S.20 for Renault. In his first
            race with Alpine he had to retire after plastic debris entered his
            brake duct. At the 2021 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix he finished in
            P11, with teammate Ocon just ahead in P10, but both would be
            upgraded one position after Kimi Räikkönen was penalised, therefore
            giving Alonso his first points of the season in his second race back
            in Formula One.

          <p>
            In 2018, Alonso raced in the 24 Hours of Daytona for the first time.
            He shared the No. 22 United Autosports Ligier JS P2 with Lando
            Norris and Philip Hanson, which finished 38th overall after

            He later raced the full 2018–19 FIA World Endurance Championship
            alongside Sébastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima at Toyota Gazoo
            Racing. Sharing the No. 8 Toyota TS050 Hybrid, the trio
            <b>won the World Drivers' Championship</b> after a season-long duel
            with their teammates Mike Conway, Kamui Kobayashi and José María
            López with

          <h4>A return in LMP2</h4>
          <p>
            Alonso returned to compete in the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2019. He
            won the rain-shortened race in a Wayne Taylor Racing-entered
            Cadillac DPi-V.R with Kobayashi, Renger van der Zande and Jordan
            Taylor.
          </p>
          <h4>Indianapolis 500</h4>
          <p>
            He first drove the Indianapolis 500 in <b>2017</b>.

            Alonso drove for McLaren Honda Andretti, qualifying in fifth
            position for the race and
            <b>leading four times for a total of 24 laps</b> before retiring
            with engine failure with 21 laps remaining while running in seventh
            place. He was classified 24th. He returned to the Indianapolis 500
            for a second time with McLaren in <b>2019</b>. An error converting
            inches to the metric system causing his car to scrape the tarmac
            surface on his first lap on track and incorrect gear ratios meant
            Alonso failed to qualify for the race. He entered the Indianapolis
            500 in <b>2020</b> for his third attempt at winning the race, this
            time with Arrow McLaren SP after an agreement with Andretti
            Autosport fell through. Alonso finished the race in 21st after
            clutch issues slowed pit stops.

            a five-month training programme testing in Africa, Europe and the
            Middle East and driving a series of races to better himself. With
            co-driver Marc Coma, he finished the event in 13th position with a
            best stage finish of second place. A stop for repairs on the second
            stage and a roll on the 10th lost him several hours in the general
            classification.
